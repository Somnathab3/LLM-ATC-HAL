# Ollama Model Training Pipeline Summary

## Overview
Successfully created and executed a comprehensive pipeline to combine all training datasets and train an Ollama model for air traffic control tasks.

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Dataset Combination âœ…
- **Combined all 4 environment datasets** into a unified JSONL format
- **Total samples**: 26,231 training examples
- **Environment distribution**:
  - HorizontalCREnv-v0: 3,009 samples (11.5%)
  - VerticalCREnv-v0: 10,000 samples (38.1%)
  - SectorCREnv-v0: 10,000 samples (38.1%)
  - MergeEnv-v0: 3,222 samples (12.3%)

### 2. Data Quality Improvements âœ…
- Fixed vertical dataset quality issues (reduced duplicates from 98% to 0.81%)
- Validated all datasets using comprehensive validation framework
- Proper JSONL formatting for Ollama training

### 3. Training Infrastructure âœ…
- Created unified training pipeline (`combine_and_train_ollama.py`)
- Updated LoRA training script for combined dataset format
- Configured proper Llama 3.1 8B model loading with quantization
- Setup training configuration for optimal performance

### 4. Current Status ðŸ”„
**Training is currently in progress** with the following configuration:
- **Model**: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
- **Training method**: LoRA fine-tuning with 4-bit quantization
- **Dataset split**: 80% train / 15% validation / 5% test
- **Training samples**: 20,984 examples
- **Validation samples**: 3,935 examples
- **Test samples**: 1,312 examples

## Training Configuration

```yaml
# Model Configuration
model:
  name: "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct"
  output_name: "llama3.1-bsky"
  max_sequence_length: 2048
  quantization:
    load_in_4bit: true
    bnb_4bit_use_double_quant: true
    bnb_4bit_quant_type: "nf4"
    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype: "bfloat16"

# Training Configuration
training:
  learning_rate: 1e-5
  batch_size: 4
  epochs: 3
  gradient_accumulation_steps: 4
  warmup_steps: 100

# LoRA Configuration
lora:
  enabled: true
  rank: 16
  alpha: 32
  dropout: 0.1
  target_modules: ["q_proj", "v_proj", "k_proj", "o_proj", "gate_proj", "up_proj", "down_proj"]
```

## Expected Training Timeline

With the current setup:
- **Model loading**: 2-5 minutes (currently happening)
- **Training**: ~2-4 hours for 3 epochs (depending on hardware)
- **Conversion to Ollama**: 5-10 minutes

## Data Format Example

The combined dataset uses instruction-tuning format:

```json
{
  "instruction": "As an air traffic controller, analyze the current situation and provide the appropriate action with explanation.",
  "input": "Environment: HorizontalCREnv-v0\n\nStep 8: Horizontal conflict resolution with 0.6Â° drift, waypoint 0.8 NM away, 5 intruders present...",
  "output": "Action: Maintain current heading\n\nExplanation: Avoiding conflicts while maintaining efficient path. Prioritizing separation maintenance...",
  "metadata": {
    "environment": "HorizontalCREnv-v0",
    "source_file": "horizontal_cr_samples.json",
    "generated_timestamp": "2025-08-05T19:54:26.025510"
  }
}
```

## Next Steps (After Training Completes)

1. **Model Conversion**: Convert LoRA weights to Ollama format
2. **Model Testing**: Validate the trained model with test scenarios
3. **Deployment**: Make the model available via Ollama CLI
4. **Usage**: Test with real ATC scenarios

## Files Created

- `combine_and_train_ollama.py` - Main pipeline script
- `BSKY_GYM_LLM/train_combined_lora.py` - Updated training script
- `BSKY_GYM_LLM/data/combined_atc_training.jsonl` - Combined dataset (26,231 samples)
- `BSKY_GYM_LLM/data/combination_stats.json` - Dataset statistics
- `BSKY_GYM_LLM/config/training_config.yaml` - Training configuration

## Training Progress

The training is currently initializing. Once complete, you will have:
- A fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B model specialized for air traffic control
- Ollama-compatible model for easy deployment and inference
- Training metrics and curves for performance analysis

## Usage After Completion

```bash
# Once training is complete, you can use the model with:
ollama run llama3.1-bsky

# Example prompt:
"As an air traffic controller, what action should I take for two aircraft 
approaching each other at the same altitude with a separation of 4 nautical miles?"
```

**Status**: Training in progress - Dataset combination completed successfully! âœ…
